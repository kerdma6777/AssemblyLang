# AssemblyLang
A program written in java that mimics code written in assembly language

The code in Java represents an object, AssemblyLang, that can mimic the function of simple assembly language programs.  Construct the object with an ArrayList of Strings.  Each String represents a line of assembly language code.  

An example assembly language program that AssemblyLang can mimic is:

READ N
A DC 1
START LOAD N
SUB =1
BE RSLT
STORE N
LOAD A
ADD =2
STORE A
BU START
RSLT END
